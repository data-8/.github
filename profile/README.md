# Data 8

The UC Berkeley Foundations of Data Science course combines three perspectives: inferential thinking, computational thinking, and real-world relevance. 
Given data arising from some real-world phenomenon, how does one analyze that data so as to understand that phenomenon? The course teaches critical 
concepts and skills in computer programming and statistical inference, in conjunction with hands-on analysis of real-world datasets, including economic data, 
document collections, geographical data, and social networks. It delves into social issues surrounding data analysis such as privacy and design.

This organization houses the textbook, assignments, exams and websites for Data 8 as well as the `datascience` package. Some early versions of connector courses 
taught in Spring 2016 are also here. If you are interested in setting up your own version of the Data 8 course, check out the [Zero to Data 8 Guide](data8.org/zero-to-data-8).
